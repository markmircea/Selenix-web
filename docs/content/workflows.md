# AI-Powered Workflows

Workflows are the intelligent heart of Selenix, enhanced by AI assistance that makes creating complex automations as simple as describing what you want to accomplish. Think of a workflow as an intelligent assistant that can understand, adapt, and execute sophisticated browser tasks automatically.

## What is an AI-Enhanced Workflow?

A Selenix workflow is a collection of **smart commands** that work together to automate complex browser tasks. Unlike traditional automation tools, Selenix workflows are enhanced with:

- **AI-generated commands** based on natural language descriptions
- **Intelligent element detection** that adapts to page changes
- **Context-aware decision making** using browser state analysis
- **Automated scheduling** for hands-free operation
- **Advanced data processing** with AI-powered transformations

### AI-Enhanced Logic
Intelligent decision making with:
- **Natural language conditions** - "If price is greater than $100"
- **Smart loops** - `forEach` loops that handle complex iterations
- **Context-aware branching** - AI suggests optimal conditional logic
- **Error recovery** - Automatic retry and alternative path selection

## Workflow Creation Methods

### Method 1: AI-Assisted Creation (Recommended)

1. Open AI Assistant panel
2. Describe your goal: *"I want to scrape product prices from this e-commerce site and export to CSV"*
3. AI analyzes the page and suggests commands
4. Review and refine the generated workflow
5. Test with AI guidance for optimization

### Method 2: Visual Recording + AI Enhancement

1. Click **Start Recording**
2. Perform actions in your browser
3. Click **Stop Recording**
4. Ask AI: *"How can I make this more reliable?"*
5. AI suggests improvements and additional commands

### Method 3: Professional Manual Building

1. Click **New Test**
2. Add commands from the 100+ command library
3. Configure advanced options for each command
4. Use AI Assistant for selector optimization
5. Implement complex logic with AI guidance

## Advanced Workflow Patterns

### Intelligent Data Collection Workflows
```
Navigate to site
├─ Create browser snapshot (save login state)
├─ Loop through pagination:
│   ├─ scrapeStructured (extract product data)
│   ├─ combineVariables (merge with existing data)
│   └─ Click next page
├─ transformVariable (clean and process data)
├─ sendToAI (intelligent data filtering)
└─ exportToCSV (save results)
```

### Scheduled Monitoring Workflows
```
Scheduled execution (daily at 9 AM)
├─ restoreSnapshot (instant login)
├─ Navigate to monitoring page
├─ monitorElement (watch for changes)
├─ IF changes detected:
│   ├─ scrapeCollection (extract new data)
│   ├─ exportToJSON (save updates)
│   └─ httpRequest (notify webhook)
└─ createSnapshot (save updated state)
```

### API Integration Workflows
```
importFromJSON (load configuration)
├─ httpRequest (fetch data from API)
├─ transformVariable (process API response)
├─ Loop through API data:
│   ├─ Navigate to web interface
│   ├─ Fill forms with API data
│   └─ scrapeCollection (verify results)
├─ combineVariables (merge web + API data)
└─ exportToCSV (comprehensive report)
```

## Best Practices for AI-Enhanced Workflows

### Leverage AI Assistance
- **Start with descriptions**: Tell the AI what you want before building
- **Ask for optimization**: "How can I make this workflow more reliable?"
- **Use for debugging**: Let AI analyze failed runs and suggest fixes
- **Request alternatives**: "What's another way to extract this data?"

### Design for Reliability
- **Use state snapshots** to avoid re-authentication
- **Implement monitoring** for critical elements that might change
- **Add AI data validation** to catch extraction errors
- **Include error recovery** with alternative paths

### Optimize for Scale
- **Schedule intelligently** to distribute load
- **Use bulk operations** for large datasets
- **Implement data deduplication** to avoid processing duplicates
- **Monitor performance** and adjust timing as needed

### Maintain Professional Standards
- **Document complex workflows** with clear descriptions
- **Version control** important automations
- **Test regularly** to catch website changes
- **Use meaningful variable names** for maintainability
